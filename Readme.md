# Google API Backend
The aim of this project is to discover different functions of Google API and come up with new idea along the way.
Starting with visual recognition that was introduced in the series of tutorial by [Jie Jen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cM8zY_dwdw&list=PL3JVwFmb_BnSLFyVThMfEavAEZYHBpWEd&index=4), I plan to create a Facebook-like facial recognition application for personal usage. 
### Getting started
1) Create a API token follow the direction [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKvffLRSyPk). Put this in the folder

2) For the pdf application, create the google cloud storage [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMaoUdJQEgY)
